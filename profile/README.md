# Welcome to SAFEHR

**SAF**EHR (pronounced simply as *safer*) is our Secure/Anonymised Framework for Electronic Health Record data at UCLH. We're a partnership between [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) and [UCLH](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk) supported and funded by the [UCLH Biomedical Research Centre](https://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk).

If you're interested in learning more, then please drop by the Institute of Health Informatics (IHI) at 222 Euston Road, or drop us an [email](mailto:uclh.criu@nhs.net).

We manage and maintain software to support health data reseearch.
